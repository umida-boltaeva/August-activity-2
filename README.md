I used the Bootstrap framework to solve the responsiveness issue. I had a few options to utilize here such as grid, flexbox, 
or just set the dimentions manually without any framework. I preferred Bootstrap over grid or doing it manually. Because 
firstly, it is a ready-to-use pack with all necesssary components, layouts and examples. Secondly, it takes much less time
as it does lots of job
