## Genereal info
This project is a simple responsive website page. While writing the code, I mostly tried to focus on accessibility features like
color contrast, font size and style, clear hover styles on links and alignment of the content.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* CSS framework Bootstrap version: 4.5.3

I used the Bootstrap framework to solve the responsiveness issue. I had a few options to utilize here such as grid, flexbox, 
or just set the dimentions manually without any framework. I preferred Bootstrap over grid or doing it manually. Because
* it is a ready-to-use pack with all necesssary components, layouts and examples;
* it takes much less time as it does lots of job with classes.

## View
I deployed this page to [Vercel](vercel.com) to check how it is working on different size screens. 
Here is the [demo](https://responsive-tau.vercel.app/).
